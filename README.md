# Missajous Simulator
A javascript simulator for Matt Parker's "Near-Missajous Curve"
See the video on youtube here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CbPksEl51Q

## Live Demo

## p5.js
This project makes use of the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) javascript library for the canvas and dom.

## How to use
Just mess around with the parameters to make interesting patterns. Try dragging the circles to different positions.

Feel free to fork this repo, play around with it and make pull requests.

### Want a challenge?
Try to find the parameters that replicate Matt-Parker's curve ([video at 402s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CbPksEl51Q&t=402s)) as close as possible.
Can you use a machine-learning algorithm to do this?
